# Modulation & Demodulation Basis

This folder contains a working Matlab 2017A GUIDE which implements the basis step of signal modulation and demodulation.

**Covered Topics:**
1. Signal Modulation and Demodulation using sinusoidal carrier.
2. Analog Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)
3. Double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission (DSB-SC) & Double Sideband with Large carrier (DSB-LC)
